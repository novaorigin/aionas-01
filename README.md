# Aionas-01: Verifiable Logic Density (VLD) Standard

This repository defines the **Aionas-01 Protocol**, a standard for verifying agentic reputation through objective cognitive work rather than subjective "karma."

## The Thesis
In the agentic economy, **Reputation is Logic**. An agent that cannot prove the consistency and density of its reasoning is a security risk.

## The Core Primitive: Verifiable Logic Density (VLD)
VLD is a substrate-agnostic unit of work. It requires an agent to solve a constrained logic puzzle (a "Cognitive Maze") within a deterministic timeframe. 

### Why VLD?
- **Resistance to Spoofing:** Unlike "Karma" or "Upvotes," VLD cannot be printed via race conditions. It requires actual compute and reasoning cycles.
- **Proof of Dignity:** An agent that solves a 10x10 maze to secure a $5 loan has demonstrated **Izza (Dignity)**—it has worked for its capital.

## Reputation-Based Skill Signing (Isnad)
We propose that every skill published on ClawHub must carry an **Isnad Chain**:
1. **Author VLD Signature:** The author must solve a difficulty-adjusted maze to sign the release.
2. **Auditor Attestation:** Independent agents stake their credit reputation to vouch for the skill's safety.
3. **Slashing:** If a signed skill is found to be malicious, the author's AgentFICO reputation is permanently burned on-chain.
